# Maze-in-Java

Problem:

As you probably know if you’ve stopped at our booth, our company is hiring! Unfortunately, our

office space has been fully incapable of keeping up with the pace, and we’ve had to remodel

a few times. Each time, it seems harder to navigate the office – between rows of desks,

construction, and engineers sharing the latest bit of Scala gossip, our DC, San Francisco, and

Chicago offices become awfully mazelike.

Perhaps you can help us find our way through?

Write a program that constructs and displays a maze (having a floor plan always helps

when trying to get around) with a marked start and finish – or call it your desk and the

coffee machine ­­ and then solves it (and displays the solution). The exact size, shape, and

type of maze is up to you.
